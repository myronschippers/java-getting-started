# Java Getting Started

The goal of this exercise is to transition from a Node stack into a Java stack. In our Node stack we have been using React for the front-end framework and we could use that in Java as well but what we are gonna take a look at is something called HTML Templating. Node has it's own HTML Templating such as [Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) and we'll take a look at the equivalent for Java in this exercise.

## Transitioning Stacks

It is not uncommon as a Software Engineer to be asked to move to a new / different stack. Equally as important as physically being able to transition to a new stack is our willingness as Software Engineers to head off into a language or way of doing things that we're not familiar with. To get a look at how we're gonna approach this transition take a look at the video linked below.

Try googling the questions posed in the video to get an idea for all of the Java options out there before moving on.

## Installation

We have 2 new things that we need to get installed on our machines before we can jump into code. The first thing is the actual Java language, just like when we installed Node.js. The second thing is going to be an IDE / Editor that is meant for working with Java. For the IDE / Editor we are going to go with Intellij. For Intellij make sure you are downloading the Community version, the Ultimate version is not free.
